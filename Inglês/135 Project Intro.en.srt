1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,190
OK, so in this project, we're going to create a live user filter where we're actually going to fetch

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:09,310
a bunch of users from an API called Random User Dot Me.

3
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:15,390
So we're going to fetch them, put them in here, and then we're going to be able to filter these users.

4
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:21,930
So if I just do if I type in an are here any user that has an R in either their name or their location

5
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:27,960
is going to show I'll do our oh, let's say let's search for this Roman guy.

6
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:33,840
So our M and you see that the only user that matches that is this Roman Roberts.

7
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,320
And if I delete it's going to still it's going to continue to filter.

8
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:44,820
OK, if I want to search for this all over and if I delete, it's going to just match whatever I put

9
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:45,250
in here.

10
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:45,590
All right.

11
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,300
So we're going to be dealing with the API.

12
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:54,020
We are going to use a sink await as opposed to the then syntax for fetch, which returns a promise.

13
00:00:54,330 --> 00:01:00,240
So we'll first create the UI style with access and then we'll fetch the data and will implement the

14
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:00,870
filtering.
