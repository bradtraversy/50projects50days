1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:06,900
OK, so now we want to fetch some data, some users from a third party API at random user dot me.

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,420
So this API is pretty simple.

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:10,920
It's it's it's open.

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,740
So you don't need any kind of key or anything like that.

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,360
You don't need to sign up for anything.

6
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:24,240
You simply make a request to random user slash a random user, me slash API and you get I think you

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:30,020
get one user by default, but you can set a query param of results and get as many as you want.

8
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,640
So we can actually just show you this in the browser.

9
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:33,840
I'm just going to copy this.

10
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:44,370
So random user API, if I run that it gives me the it looks like it gives me one user, but if I put

11
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:52,080
on this a query string, so if I do questionmark and then results and set that, let's set that to 20,

12
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:59,610
you'll see it gives me 20 users and it gives you all kinds of fields, your name, name, location with

13
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:05,720
a full address, age, phone number, even password, username and password.

14
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:09,280
So it's a really useful API for just like dummy data.

15
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,260
So that's what we're going to use.

16
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:16,650
So let's close that up, go into our script and I'm going to start off here by just bringing in what

17
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:17,020
I need.

18
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,160
So let's bring in the result.

19
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:27,330
So in our index, each time we have this right here, the USA, with the idea of result.

20
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,670
So we want to bring that in.

21
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:34,620
So document dot, I'll go ahead and use git element by these and result.

22
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,910
And then we also want our filter, which is our input.

23
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:45,920
So that has an idea filter or at least it should just make sure I put that.

24
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,200
Yeah.

25
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,080
So idea filter right here.

26
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:58,200
OK, so bringing in those and the next thing I want to do is just initialize a very an array here called

27
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,660
list items and it's going to be just an empty array.

28
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:08,940
So basically where we're going to put the data that we fetch and let's create a function and this is

29
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,190
going to be asynchronous because I'm going to use a sink away.

30
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:13,260
I'm not going to use the DOT then syntax.

31
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:23,230
So I'll say async function and we'll call this get data and let's say Congress.

32
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:26,250
So this is going to represent the response from our request.

33
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,520
Now, this fêtes returns a promise.

34
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:34,740
So we want to await since we're using a sink away, we want to await, fetch and let's pass in here

35
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:42,660
http s random user dot mi slash API and I'm going to get fifty.

36
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:48,150
So we'll do let's say results equals fifty.

37
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,970
OK, now what the API.

38
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:55,140
We need to then call resident Jason to get our data.

39
00:02:55,150 --> 00:03:02,820
So let's create a variable called data and let's await because this right here, this says that's going

40
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:06,500
to be this resident Jason here is going to be a promise.

41
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:07,950
We want to await that.

42
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:13,200
And then that should give us our data and I'll go ahead and just cancel log data just so we can test

43
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:13,740
this out.

44
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:17,700
And we're going to run this function right here, say get data.

45
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:24,240
And then if we go over here and open up our console, we should see, OK, so we get an object with

46
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:24,840
two things.

47
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:31,080
We have info and this has like I guess pagination and stuff like that, the number of results, the

48
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:31,710
page.

49
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:37,260
So results is what we want in this should have 50 different users.

50
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:38,660
All right.

51
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:40,350
So let's.

52
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:42,650
Let's go down here.

53
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:53,470
Let's get rid of this console log here and I want to clear the results before we do anything.

54
00:03:53,470 --> 00:04:03,100
So we'll say results and set the inner HTML results start in our HTML, set that to just an empty string.

55
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:09,910
And then we're going to have to loop through the data here, actually know what we can do since we need

56
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:15,310
to do data dot results, because remember, this gets an object with info in results.

57
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:22,870
So we could we could go down here and say data dot results or we can just d structure here so we can

58
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:26,700
just pull out results from the data, actually.

59
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:33,130
Yeah, that's fine, because we called this result singular so we can use the results here and then

60
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:35,710
we can just grab that and we can loop through that.

61
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:37,030
So for each.

62
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:45,910
For each so say for each user, because that's what it is.

63
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:52,980
So each user then let's go ahead and I just want to console log here user just to make sure we're getting

64
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:55,680
this good so you can see it's logging all the users.

65
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,830
And let's construct an ally, because right now in our HTML, we just have you know, we have the intel,

66
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:09,780
we do have the loading here, which is going to show initially, but we want to construct the list item

67
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:12,140
for that are going to have the users.

68
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:22,230
So let's do that in this foreach will say const ally and let's use document dot create element because

69
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:30,300
we want to create a list item for each of these users and then we want to take our list items array,

70
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:37,980
which starts off as an empty array, and then we want to push on each of the allies.

71
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:46,020
OK, so we push that on and then we'll take the lie and add the inner HTML.

72
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:52,790
So this is going to be, you know, similar to the hardcoded HTML that we had for each user.

73
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:59,760
It'll have the image and stuff like that, which we can get from this user object that's passed in to

74
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,720
this foreach when we loop through the array.

75
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:12,900
So in here, let's say image and set the source and we want to set this to we're going to use this variable

76
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,170
syntax and let's take the user now.

77
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:20,550
We can access user dot picture and then there's different sizes.

78
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:21,840
I'm going to do large.

79
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:28,230
So user picture large and you can see all this stuff if you make a request, you know, either in your

80
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:36,870
browser or with something like Postman or whatever the ALZ, I'm going to use the the user's first name.

81
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,140
So we have user dot name dot first.

82
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,750
And if you're wondering, you know where I get this name dot first and stuff on this picture dot large,

83
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,220
every API is different.

84
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:52,140
You just have to, you can look at the documentation to see what it gives you.

85
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:54,450
Actually we can see right down here where I logged it.

86
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:55,800
Let's see.

87
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,850
So you can see name.

88
00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:00,390
So name is actually an object with first last and title.

89
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,330
So I'm getting the first picture.

90
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:08,760
Should be in here somewhere to so picture we have large medium thumbnail so it just depends on the API.

91
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,730
I know when I first started learning this stuff it confused me.

92
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:13,230
Like where did you get this from.

93
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:17,290
It just it depends on the data that's being sent from the API.

94
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:25,350
Same thing with, you know, here where we get results, sometimes some APIs, the data might just come

95
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:32,430
as, you know, one array or our single array or it might come in different objects like a results object.

96
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,620
This one also had an info object.

97
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,410
So it just depends on the data you're dealing with.

98
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,500
So this image here, let's finish this up.

99
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:52,070
And then we have under the image, we have a div and let's give this a class of user Dasch info

100
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:57,670
and user info, we're going to have the name.

101
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:03,680
So it's going to be in an age four and that's going to be the first and last name.

102
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:11,870
So let's go ahead and get the user dot name dot first and then MySpace and then we'll get user dot name

103
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,070
dot last.

104
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:17,910
And then underneath that we'll have our power graph and this is going to be the location.

105
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:28,940
So with this particular API in the data it gives us, we have access to user location, dot city, and

106
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:32,210
then I'm going to put a comma and then I want to get the country.

107
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:37,460
So user dot location, dot country.

108
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:41,010
OK, and you can see that right down here.

109
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:45,630
So in location you have city, you can have coordinates.

110
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:47,380
So you could place them on a map.

111
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:49,580
I mean, you can do a lot with this little API.

112
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:51,980
So that's that.

113
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:55,430
Now we have the list item created.

114
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:59,320
We added it to the array, we added the entire HTML.

115
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:02,990
Now we just need to put it into the result, into the HTML.

116
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,930
So we have that result that we pulled in.

117
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:11,540
That's the you'll we want to append child because we're putting this elai into the U.S. So we want to

118
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:13,220
just pass lie in there.

119
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:14,640
All right.

120
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:20,450
So if I save that, you can see here now we're getting 50 closer.

121
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,970
So we're getting 50 different users.

122
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:29,900
Now, the loading shouldn't be showing, and that's because it should be clear result.

123
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:32,630
So I'm not clearing the results.

124
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:36,200
The data I got, it's the result you all that I brought in.

125
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,640
So let's save that.

126
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,790
And I can see that's not going to show now for the filtering.

127
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:44,420
We need to have an event listener when we type in this input.

128
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:50,450
So let's go right down to where we call, get data initially and let's take the filter, which is the

129
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:53,390
input and let's add an event listener on to it.

130
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:56,090
And we want to listen for any input.

131
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:02,420
And when that happens, we're going to fire off fire off an event that's going to call a function.

132
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:08,030
We're going to pass our event, object in and then call a function called filtered data that we're going

133
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:15,680
to create and we just want to pass in e so our event dot target dot value, which is going to give us

134
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,210
whatever is being typed in.

135
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:27,410
So down here, let's create our function for filter data and that's going to take in let's call search

136
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:27,890
term.

137
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:35,150
So whatever is being typed in and just to show you can console log search term.

138
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:44,030
And if we open our console up here and I start to type, you can see we can capture whatever we're typing.

139
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:52,350
So I'm going to then take the list items, which is the, you know, the array of users and loop through.

140
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:56,560
So we'll say for each call this item.

141
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,810
So for each item I want to check.

142
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:09,840
So we want to basically check to see if it matches the user so we can do that by taking the item, see

143
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:13,680
if the item dot in our text.

144
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:18,390
So in our text for the item, remember list items is the elai.

145
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:23,850
So we're going to go through the allies and check each item and check the inner text and I'm going to

146
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:32,670
make it lowercase by using to lowercase like that, because even if we even if we type in uppercase,

147
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:33,810
I still want it to match.

148
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:38,910
So we'll first convert it to lowercase and then we're going to use the includes method.

149
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:45,270
So we'll say if the inner text, when it's lowercase or not, when but we're going to convert it to

150
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:51,390
lowercase if that includes the search term that's passed in to this function.

151
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:53,640
And we also want to make that lowercase.

152
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,040
So they're both going to be lowercase.

153
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,030
We're going to match that.

154
00:11:57,030 --> 00:12:02,460
If it matches, then we want to remove any class of hide.

155
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:07,200
Remember, the high class is just set to display none, right this right here.

156
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:18,540
So we want to just take the item and set class list, dot remove and we want to remove any classified

157
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:19,800
else.

158
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:26,760
So if it doesn't match, basically if we're not matching what we type in, then we want to add the class

159
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,190
of hide.

160
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:34,660
So let's say item dot, class list, dot, add and then we want to add the class of hide.

161
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:41,160
OK, so now you can see we have Rothesay, Roger right here.

162
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:48,750
If I do r so now it's going to filter anything that has an R is going to be included here and this includes

163
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:49,850
anything that's in here.

164
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,510
So the name and location.

165
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:54,590
So you can see these all have ours somewhere in here.

166
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:54,900
Right.

167
00:12:55,310 --> 00:13:01,290
Let's do our O and now it's only giving us either names or locations with R.

168
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:02,310
Oh G.

169
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,390
And that leaves us with Roger.

170
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:06,020
All right.

171
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:10,290
If I do you know Roger and then I start typing more letters, it's not going to match.

172
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:18,840
And if I remove, it's going to if this you know, if it matches again, it's going to remove the classified.

173
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:23,190
So it's just adding and removing that Hyde class as we type and as we delete.

174
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:24,330
Right.

175
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,530
So that's it.

176
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:31,650
And you can apply this to to, you know, any kind of list that you want to be able to search through.

177
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,540
Really easy to put together.

178
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:34,870
But that's it.

179
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:37,170
It's go ahead and move on to the next project.
