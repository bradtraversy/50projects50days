1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,790
All right, so we're gonna get started on the on access for this project.

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:08,520
So let's jump into our index e-mail here for the project starter.

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,760
So we're going to call this live user filter.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,900
And let's go ahead and get rid of this one here.

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:25,530
So basically, we're going to have a we're going to have a container here and then we want the the input

6
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:28,650
and underneath that will have an analyst with the users.

7
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:33,750
Ultimately, the users will come from the API that we're going to fetch from, you know, through the

8
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:34,530
JavaScript.

9
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,530
But for now, we're just going to hardcoded them just so we can see it.

10
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:38,400
We can style it.

11
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,940
Then we'll move on to, you know, making it dynamic.

12
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,290
So let's create a header here.

13
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,750
Go ahead and just create a class of header.

14
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:55,870
And let's use an age for give it a class of title and say live use or filter, and underneath that age

15
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:59,620
four, I'm going to put a small tag and give this a class of subtitle.

16
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:07,720
And here we'll say search by name and or location.

17
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:15,930
And then under that small tag is going to be our input and the input is going to have an idea of filter.

18
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:24,010
Type text, and let's just add a placeholder to it, so Placeholder will say search.

19
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:31,450
OK, so that's the header, so we can go underneath that div, actually we can use a header tag here,

20
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:37,210
he's a header tag and then underneath the header, let's do our U.

21
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:40,210
L am going to give this an idea of result.

22
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:45,540
This is where we want our results to show up and we're going to give it a class of user Dasch list.

23
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:48,400
All right.

24
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:54,460
So inside this ule, like I said, the the list items are going to be generated with dynamic data,

25
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,290
but for now, we're just going to hardcoded them.

26
00:01:56,290 --> 00:02:07,870
So let's add an image here and I'm going to use https and let's use random user MI API, which where

27
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:10,900
we're just going to get just a static image now.

28
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:16,780
But later on, when we actually fetch the users, the random users, it's going to be from the same

29
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:17,800
API.

30
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:24,460
You can use it just to insert a random user image or you can make a request to get some Jason data for

31
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,420
random users.

32
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:35,080
So right now we're just going to do portrait portraits slash and then we can do like women slash 33

33
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,010
JPEG.

34
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,760
If I save that, we're going to get a random image here.

35
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:46,000
And then for the ALZ, we'll just use a name, say, Sahra, and under the image here we're going to

36
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:54,280
have a class of user dash info and in here will have an H for with the name, let's say Sarah Smith.

37
00:02:54,730 --> 00:03:02,020
And underneath that let's do a paragraph with the location will say Wexford Ireland.

38
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,270
And then what I'll do is just copy that list item and I'll just put two more, I'm just going to use

39
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:13,440
the same image and name.

40
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,790
It's fine because like I said, this is going to come in from the API.

41
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,940
Ultimately, we also want an ally for that.

42
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,430
Just says loading while we're fetching the data.

43
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,900
So I'm going to put that in as well.

44
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:30,300
So that has to be a list item within page three that says loading dot, dot, dot.

45
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:33,130
OK, so that'll be our HTML.

46
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,030
Now let's jump into our stylesheet.

47
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:41,250
So for the styling, see, we use this font for the body.

48
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:55,020
I'm going to add a background color of hexadecimal, Efate F nine F.D. and C display Fleck's.

49
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:59,670
We can get rid of the Flex Direction column on everything centered.

50
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,200
OK, that's good.

51
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:04,500
Now the container wraps around everything.

52
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:13,070
So for that, let's add a border radius of five pixels and I'm going to add a box shadow.

53
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:23,460
So for the box shadow, let's do three pixels for both of the offsets, 10 pixels, blah, blah, for

54
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:30,840
the color, which is going to be black, and then zero point three for the transparency actions to point

55
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,380
to.

56
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:37,060
And why aren't we seeing that, because I spelt container wrong.

57
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:38,900
There we go.

58
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:42,280
So now you can see the border radius with the box shadow.

59
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:47,260
Let's also add overflow hidden.

60
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:53,170
So how many scroll bars, the width, I'm going to set that to 300 pixels.

61
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:56,120
OK, so that should do it for the container.

62
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:01,860
So the title here, let's remove any margin from that.

63
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:11,520
So margin zero and then for the subtitle, oops, let's go let's go under here and add the subtitle.

64
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:18,660
And I want to display that as an inline block because remember that's a small tag which by default is

65
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,290
in line.

66
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:29,100
And then I'm going to add a margin of five pixels, zero 20 pixels, and I'm going to add an opacity

67
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:33,810
of zero point eight, which will make it even, you know, faded a little bit.

68
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,750
And let's see for the header.

69
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,290
So we have a class of header.

70
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:44,460
Let's add a background color for that.

71
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:53,490
And that's going to be three, say, three five seven DB for that background.

72
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,340
And then the color will be white.

73
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:05,310
And then let's add padding for let's do 30 pixels, top and bottom, 20 pixels left and right.

74
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:08,670
OK, so our header is starting to look a little better now.

75
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,470
The input, we want to style that.

76
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:13,920
So let's say the header input.

77
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:22,230
I want to set the background color to be a value.

78
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:31,800
Zero zero zero so black and then zero point three, so it just looks, you know, has that kind of transparent

79
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,740
look to get a get rid of that ugly border.

80
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,040
Let's do a border radius.

81
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:45,640
We're going to make this rounded, so 50 pixels for that and the color of the text is going to be white.

82
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,050
And let's set the font size.

83
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:58,780
So font size is going to set to 14 pixels, this is on the input and then we're going to set the padding.

84
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:08,250
Let's do 10 top and bottom, 15 left and right, and then let's make it go all the way across so we'll

85
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,170
set the with two 100 percent.

86
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:13,100
All right.

87
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:24,880
And I also want to get rid of this this border here, so let's say heter input's focus, we want to

88
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,010
set the outline to let's do not.

89
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:37,720
OK, so of get rid of that ugly outline, good, so the next thing I want to do is this user list here.

90
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:50,930
So it's a you and has a class of user Dasch list and let's set the background color to white and let's

91
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:53,990
set the list style.

92
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,260
We'll do list style, type none, which will get rid of the bullet points.

93
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,160
We don't want those.

94
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:07,850
And then I'm going to remove any margin and let's set a max height here of 400 pixels because you don't

95
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:09,080
want this to be too long.

96
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:14,930
We're actually going to have a little scroll here, if, you know, to to check out all the users in

97
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:21,440
the list and then let's do an overflow, because right now we won't have any scroll bars.

98
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:26,420
But if we set overflow, why so basically on the Y axis, let's set that to auto.

99
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:31,730
And if we need scroll bars, it's going to give us this little scroll bar on the side, which doesn't

100
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:32,330
look too bad.

101
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:38,020
And then finally, let's set padding to zero as well.

102
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:41,240
And I'm just going to move that up next to the margin.

103
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,010
All right.

104
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:44,180
So now the list items.

105
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:56,710
So we have our user list and we want to style the allies I'm going to display as a flex box and let's

106
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:59,890
set padding to 20 pixels.

107
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:06,970
OK, now let's do let's see.

108
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:20,210
All right, let's do the let's do the image so we have a user list image and I want it to be rounded,

109
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:23,230
so we'll use border radius at that to 50 percent.

110
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,350
That'll make it rounded.

111
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:29,480
And let's do object fit cover.

112
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:36,940
We want the whole image to show in there, and then we're going to make the width and the height 50

113
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:37,630
pixels.

114
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:49,640
OK, so kind of small, but I think that looks all right, the user info, so we have user dash list,

115
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:53,780
dot user info.

116
00:09:56,150 --> 00:10:02,690
For that, let's set margin left to take it away from the image, some margin left 10 pixels that will

117
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:07,820
push it over and then let's set on the floor.

118
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:18,500
I'm just going to grab this through the floor and they're going to set margin zero zero ten pixels.

119
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:21,050
And for the paragraph,

120
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:31,010
let's just set the font size to 12 pixels will make that a little smaller.

121
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:31,990
All right.

122
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,080
That doesn't look too bad.

123
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,910
Let's have a border one, a border in between.

124
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:41,180
But we don't want to border on the last list item.

125
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:47,720
So what we can do is say user list and then the ally.

126
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,660
And I'm going to use the pseudo selector of not.

127
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:57,890
And in here we use the pseudo of last of type.

128
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:07,920
So basically what we're saying here is, you know, any list item that is not the last, then we want

129
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,150
to add a border bottom.

130
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:17,580
So let's say border dash bottom and we'll set that to one pixel solid and let's do triple E for the

131
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,060
color.

132
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:20,360
OK, so we have a slight border there.

133
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:27,840
Now we're going to have a class of hide because when we start to, you know, filter these users, if

134
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:32,060
it matches, we want to add the class of hide, which will basically display none.

135
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:35,130
So let's say user list elai.

136
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:41,340
And if it has a class of hide, then we're going to want to display none.

137
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:51,150
OK, so if I manually, you know, come over here and put on one of these allies, a class of high that's

138
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:51,990
going to get rid of it.

139
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:57,130
OK, but obviously that will be dynamic because we want to filter it out with whatever we type here.

140
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,510
So I think we should be good.

141
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,900
The loading you know, the loading will show before any any of these users show.

142
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:09,180
Right now, we just hardcoded it in here just so we could see.

143
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,700
So now I'm just going to remove everything, all these allies except for the loading.

144
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:19,890
So we'll get rid of those now that we know that those are styled correctly and save.

145
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:24,270
OK, so our basically our UI here is is complete.
